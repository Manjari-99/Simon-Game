### Rules:
* Press any Key to Start.
* Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color.
* Simon will add a new signal. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.
* Simon will keep adding new signals. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.
* If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly Simon responds with a sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
